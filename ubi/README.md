# Edge Computing Provider(ECP)

**ECP (Edge Computing Provider)** specializes in processing data at the source of data generation, using minimal latency setups ideal for real-time applications. This provider handles specific, localized tasks directly on devices at the network’s edge, such as IoT devices. 

At the current stage, ECP supports the generation of **ZK-Snark proof of Filecoin network**, and more ZK proof types will be gradually supported, such as Aleo, Scroll, starkNet, etc

## Prerequisites
 - Need to map the ECP service port of the intranet to the public network, the default port is`9085`:
```
 <Intranet_IP>:<9085> --> <Public_IP>:<PORT>
```
 - Running the `setup.sh`
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swanchain/go-computing-provider/releases/ubi/setup.sh | bash
```

 - Download the v28 parameters for `ZK-FIL` task:
```bash
# At least 200G storage is needed
export PARENT_PATH="<V28_PARAMS_PATH>"

# 512MiB parameters
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swanchain/go-computing-provider/releases/ubi/fetch-param-512.sh | bash

# 32GiB parameters
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swanchain/go-computing-provider/releases/ubi/fetch-param-32.sh | bash

```
## Install ECP and Init CP Account
- Download `computing-provider`
```bash
wget https://github.com/swanchain/go-computing-provider/releases/download/v0.5.0/computing-provider
```

- Initialize ECP repo
```bash
 ./computing-provider init --multi-address=/ip4/<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>/tcp/<YOUR_PORT> --node-name=<YOUR_NODE_NAME>
```
- Generate a new wallet address and deposit the `SWAN-ETH`, refer [here](https://docs.swanchain.io/swan-testnet/atom-accelerator-race/before-you-get-started/claim-sepoliaeth):
```bash
./computing-provider wallet new
```
Output: 
```
 0x9024a875f44172591373b92...31d67AcCEa
```

 - **[OPTIONAL]** You can also import your own wallet by private key

```
./computing-provider wallet import private.key
```

>**Note:** 
>1. By default, the CP's repo is `~/.swan/computing`, you can configure it by `export CP_PATH="<YOUR_CP_PATH>"`
>
>2. `private.key` is a file that contains the private key



- Initialize ECP Account
```bash
./computing-provider account create \
                    --ownerAddress <YOUR_OWNER_ADDRESS> \
                    --workerAddress <YOUR_WORKER_ADDRESS> \
                    --beneficiaryAddress <YOUR_BENEFICIAERY_ADDRESS>  \
                    --task-types 1,2,4
```
**Note:** `--task-types`: Supports 4 task types (1: Fil-C2-512M, 2: Aleo, 3: AI, 4: Fil-C2-32G), separated by commas. For ECP, it needs to be set to 1,2,4.
- Collateral Swan-ETH for ECP
```bash
./computing-provider collateral add --ecp --from <YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>  <AMOUNT>   
```
**Note:** Currently one zk-task requires 0.0005 Swan-ETH.

## Start ECP service
```bash
#!/bin/bash
export FIL_PROOFS_PARAMETER_CACHE=$PARENT_PATH
export RUST_GPU_TOOLS_CUSTOM_GPU="GeForce RTX 4090:16384"   
        
nohup ./computing-provider ubi daemon >> cp.log 2>&1 &
```
**Note:**
-  `<FIL_PROOFS_PARAMETER_CACHE>` is your parameters directory,
- `RUST_GPU_TOOLS_CUSTOM_GPU` is your GPU model and cores, you should update it to your own GPU model. More examples can be found [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/bellperson?tab=readme-ov-file#supported--tested-cards)
- `<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>`, `<YOUR_PORT>` are your public IP and port ,
- `<YOUR_NODE_NAME>` is your CP name which will show in the dashboard, If not specified, the default is `hostname`.
